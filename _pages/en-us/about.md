Hi! I’m Kunpeng (Chris), a <span style="color:#b509ac">Postdoctoral Fellow</span> at *Li-Lab*, McGill University, where I work with <a href='https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~yueli/'>Prof. Yue Li</a> and <a href='https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/index.html'>Prof. Archer Y. Yang</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the *ProspectUs-Lab*, UdeS, where I worked with <a href='https://www.usherbrooke.ca/recherche/fr/specialistes/details/shengrui.wang'>Prof. Shengrui Wang</a>. My academic journey is driven by a deep appreciation for mathematics and its elegant structures, which fuel my passion for research. I am particularly fascinated by theoretical derivations and the beauty of mathematical.

My research interests include time series analysis, kernel learning, and self-representation learning, single-cell multi-omics, and gene regulatory network inference. I focus on forecasting, pattern mining, concept drift, and interpretability in time series; explore the theoretical connections between data-driven kernel learning and transformers; and investigate subspace clustering and its applications in AI. I am also interested in AI4Science, particularly in exploring regime shifts in atmospheric and oceanic systems within environmental ecology, as well as phase transitions in physics.

In addition to my PhD work, I spent a year as a visiting scholar at an autonomous driving research institute (UISEE), where I focused on reinforcement learning. Currently, we are collaborating with a Canada Financial Company (Laplace Insights) to explore Regime-switch in financial time series.
Outside of my research, I am learning French to better integrate into the local community. 

**<a href='#'>Update.</a>** I start **<span style="color:#b509ac">postdoc fellow at School of Computer Science, McGill University</span>**, focusing on representation learning, explainable AI (XAI) for Healthcare data, single-cell multi-omics, and gene regulatory network inference, along with broader areas of machine learning, with a strong emphasis on practical applications.

[//]: # (I will be graduating soon and I am looking for postdoc/full time research positions in representation learning/XAI of time series and more broadly in machine learning, motivated by a practical application.)
