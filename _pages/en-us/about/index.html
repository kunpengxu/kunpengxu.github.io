<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Kunpeng (Chris), a <span style="color:#b509ac">Postdoctoral Fellow</span> at <em>Li-Lab</em>, McGill University, where I work with <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~yueli/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Yue Li</a> and <a href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Archer Y. Yang</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the <em>ProspectUs-Lab</em>, UdeS, where I worked with <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/recherche/fr/specialistes/details/shengrui.wang" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Shengrui Wang</a>. My academic journey is driven by a deep appreciation for mathematics and its elegant structures, which fuel my passion for research. I am particularly fascinated by theoretical derivations and the beauty of mathematical.</p> <p>My research interests include time series analysis, kernel learning, and self-representation learning, single-cell multi-omics, and gene regulatory network inference. I focus on forecasting, pattern mining, concept drift, and interpretability in time series; explore the theoretical connections between data-driven kernel learning and transformers; and investigate subspace clustering and its applications in AI. I am also interested in AI4Science, particularly in exploring regime shifts in atmospheric and oceanic systems within environmental ecology, as well as phase transitions in physics.</p> <p>In addition to my PhD work, I spent a year as a visiting scholar at an autonomous driving research institute (UISEE), where I focused on reinforcement learning. Currently, we are collaborating with a Canada Financial Company (Laplace Insights) to explore Regime-switch in financial time series. Outside of my research, I am learning French to better integrate into the local community.</p> <p><strong><a href="#">Update.</a></strong> I start <strong><span style="color:#b509ac">postdoc fellow at School of Computer Science, McGill University</span></strong>, focusing on representation learning, explainable AI (XAI) for Healthcare data, single-cell multi-omics, and gene regulatory network inference, along with broader areas of machine learning, with a strong emphasis on practical applications.</p> </body></html>
